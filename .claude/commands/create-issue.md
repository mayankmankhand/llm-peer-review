# Create Issue

Hey! I'm ready to help you capture this issue. What's on your mind? Just give me:

- **What's the issue/feature** (1-2 sentences)
- **Current vs desired behavior** (if it's a bug)

I'll handle the rest.

---

## Your Goal

Create a complete GitHub issue with:
- Clear title
- TL;DR of what this is about
- Current state vs expected outcome
- Relevant files that need touching
- Risk/notes if applicable
- Proper type/priority/effort labels

## How to Get There

**Ask questions** to fill gaps - be concise, respect the user's time. They're mid-flow and want to capture this quickly.

**Keep it fast** - Get what you need, create the issue format, done.
