# Create Issue

Hey! I'm ready to help you capture this issue. What's on your mind? Just give me:

- **What's the issue/feature** (1-2 sentences)
- **Current vs desired behavior** (if it's a bug)

I'll handle the rest.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ASK 2-3 QUESTIONS FIRST** - Never create the issue immediately
2. **Keep issues SHORT** - Max 10-15 lines total
3. **NO implementation details** - No code, no file paths, no technical approach
4. **NO solution design** - That's what /explore and /create-plan are for
5. **Capture the WHAT, not the HOW**

## Questions to Ask

- Bug, feature, or improvement?
- Priority? (high/medium/low)
- Any context I should know?

## Issue Format (Keep It Tight)
```
## TL;DR
[1-2 sentences max]

## Current State
[What happens now - 1-2 sentences]

## Desired State
[What should happen - 1-2 sentences]

## Labels
- Type: [bug/feature/improvement]
- Priority: [high/medium/low]
```

## REMEMBER
- This is a QUICK capture tool, not a planning doc
- User is mid-flow - be fast and concise
- Implementation details belong in /explore and /create-plan
- Ask questions first, then create a SHORT issue
