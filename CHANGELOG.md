# Changelog

## v4.0 - Plans Unlocked

### Changed
- **Plan location** - Plans moved from `.claude/plans/` to `plans/` at the project root. The `.claude/` directory is a protected path in Claude Code - only `commands`, `agents`, and `skills` subdirectories are excepted. Plans in `.claude/plans/` triggered permission prompts on every read/write, even in "Edit automatically" mode. Moving to `plans/` eliminates this friction.
- **setup.sh migration** - Setup now automatically detects and moves existing plan files from `.claude/plans/` to `plans/` when updating downstream projects. The old `.claude/plans/` directory is removed if empty.
- **Documentation** - All references to `.claude/plans/` updated across commands, skills, rules, README, and .gitignore.

---

## v3.5 - Skills Layer

### Added
- **Skills architecture** - Review commands migrated to `.claude/skills/` for agent discoverability
- **`/review` command** - Unified orchestrator that auto-detects changes, dispatches specialist skills in parallel, and combines findings into one report
- **`/review-deps` skill** - Dependency and supply chain security review (npm audit, outdated packages, maintainer risks, licenses)
- **`/codebase-to-course` command** - Turn any codebase into an interactive HTML learning guide
- **`project-context` skill** - Agent-only skill that provides project context to subagents
- **browse.js improvements** - Server auto-start (opt-in), accessibility scanning via axe-core, responsive viewport screenshots
- **Shared reference files** - `.claude/skills/shared/` eliminates duplicated content across review skills

### Changed
- Review commands (review-code, review-ux, review-plan, review-commands, review-browser, review-full) are now skills with SKILL.md format
- `/learning-opportunity` migrated to skill format (Claude can now offer it proactively)
- setup.sh copies `.claude/skills/` directories and handles legacy cleanup
- Browser QA now requires `@axe-core/playwright` for accessibility testing (optional)
- settings.local.json adds `npm audit` and `npm outdated` permissions

### Migration
- Re-run setup.sh to upgrade: old review command files are automatically deleted
- Add `@axe-core/playwright` to browser QA dependencies: `npm install @axe-core/playwright`
- Add `"Bash(npm audit *)"` and `"Bash(npm outdated *)"` to settings.local.json permissions if you have a custom config

---

## 3.4

- **Auto-generated project index** (issue #70) - New `/index` command and `INDEX.md` file. A deterministic Node script (`.claude/scripts/generate-index.js`) generates a file tree of all git-tracked files as indented markdown lists. Helps Claude understand project structure without burning tokens on blind exploration.
  - `setup.sh` generates `INDEX.md` on first run and copies the generator script
  - `/document` regenerates `INDEX.md` after each session
  - `/index` rebuilds `INDEX.md` on demand
  - `/explore` reads `INDEX.md` at the start of Phase 2 (falls back to manual discovery if missing)
  - `INDEX.md` is gitignored (local-only, machine-generated)
  - New permission: `node .claude/scripts/generate-index.js`

---

## 3.3

- **Self-Service guidance** (issue #69) - New "Self-Service" section in `toolkit.md` tells Claude to run commands itself instead of asking the user. Covers dev servers, tests, builds, dependency installs, service status checks, and linting. Explicit carve-outs for screenshots, judgment calls, and destructive actions.

---

## 3.2

- **Demo script** (issue #66) - Added `DEMO-SCRIPT.md`, a 5-minute presenter's script for live-demoing the full toolkit workflow. Covers explore, plan, execute, review, and AI peer review using a sample task. Includes timing markers, narration cues, fallback tips, and a pre-demo checklist.
- **Fix procedure block in debate commands** (issue #61) - Steps 6 (Present Results) and 7 (Await Approval) were outside the `<procedure>` block in both `ask-gpt.md` and `ask-gemini.md`. Moved the closing tag to after Step 7.
- **Fix Write tool guard in subagents** (issue #67) - When `/ask-gpt` or `/ask-gemini` runs as a background subagent, the Write tool rejects new file creation without a prior Read. Added Read-before-Write pattern at all 4 file creation points in both commands. Also replaced shell `cat` concatenation in Step 5 with Read/Write instructions.

---

## 3.0

- **Review findings cleanup** - Fixed broken internal link in README.md, SETUP.md step ordering (npm install before clone), and CHANGELOG strikethrough dead weight from v1.4.
- **`/peer-review` rewrite** - Was 23 lines of unstructured prose. Now has a severity-based evaluation framework, verdict summary table, and structured output template matching other review commands.
- **`/pair-debug` approval step** - Added Step 5 ("Wait for Approval") so the command doesn't dead-end after presenting a fix report.
- **`/execute` blocker examples** - "Critical blocker" is now defined with concrete examples (API incompatibility, bad architecture) vs. non-blockers (typos, syntax errors).
- **`/review-full` wording** - Clarified "don't reproduce specialist reviews" to mean "don't duplicate effort, but do recommend which specialist command to run next."
- **`/create-plan` parallel examples** - Added a concrete example of parallel vs sequential steps.
- **`browse.js` error messages** - Error messages now keep the first 3 lines instead of truncating to just the first, preserving debugging info from Playwright errors.
- **AGENT-SETUP.md fix** - "What gets updated" section now lists browse.js alongside ask-gpt.js and ask-gemini.js.

---

## 2.4

- **`/explore` vision mode** (issue #65) - The `/explore` command now has two gears. **Scoping mode** (default, existing behavior) for concrete features. **Vision mode** for strategy, ideation, and "I'm not sure what to build yet" thinking. Claude auto-detects which mode based on your input and announces the pick. Say "switch to vision mode" or "switch to scoping mode" at any time to override.
  - Vision mode questions: 10-star thinking, premise challenges, temporal questions, permission to scrap and rethink
  - Scope Dial: after exploring, pick Expand / Hold / Reduce to transition from big-picture to concrete direction
  - Phase 2 (codebase analysis) is optional in vision mode - skip straight to `/create-plan` if there's no code to analyze yet
  - Mixed-signal tiebreaker: defaults to scoping mode when input is ambiguous
- **`/explore` optional ASCII diagrams** - Phase 2 now includes lightweight ASCII diagrams when the feature involves flows, data paths, or multi-step processes. Claude auto-includes, asks, or skips based on the feature. Diagrams use indented arrows to surface hidden assumptions - each arrow is a place where things can break. Inspired by gstack's approach (issue #64).
- **Setup scripts now copy `browse.js`** - Previously, setup.sh and setup.ps1 only copied ask-gpt.js and ask-gemini.js. Now browse.js is included in both preflight checks and the copy step, so `/review-browser` works in new projects.
- **Playwright/chromium install guidance** - AGENT-SETUP.md, README.md, SETUP.md, and the setup script output now include optional steps for installing playwright-core and chromium. Dependency verification commands added ("Check what's already installed").
- **README "Full Setup (All Features)" section** - One-stop sequence for users who want every optional dependency installed, with verification commands.
- **`/review-browser` prompt improvements** - Self-healing server check (no forced question), auth wall guidance, confirmation step after initial screenshot, session cap (3-5, max 8), failure recovery guidance, `Why` field in finding template, network failure example in docs.
- **`/explore` prompt improvements** - UI/UX Preferences scope fixed (works after vision mode Hold/Reduce), Scope Dial Expand termination (caps at 3), mixed-signal tiebreaker asks user instead of silently defaulting, phase markers for transitions, vision-mode closing summary maps to `/create-plan` fields and includes diagrams.

---

## 2.3

- **`/review-browser` command** (issue #63) - QA a running web app using a headless browser. Claude navigates pages, clicks buttons, fills forms, takes screenshots, and reports findings with visual evidence. Uses a single-session JSON-in/JSON-out model with passive diagnostics (console errors, page errors, failed network requests).
- **`scripts/browse.js`** - Standalone headless browser script powered by Playwright. Accepts a JSON action sequence via stdin, runs all actions in one browser session, and returns structured JSON results. Supports `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `screenshot`, `text`, and `wait` actions with selector prefixes (`css:`, `text:`, `role:`).
- **`playwright-core` dependency** - Library-only install (no auto-download). Browser binary installed separately via `npx playwright-core install chromium`.
- **`/review-ux` cross-reference** - Updated to point users to `/review-browser` for testing running applications.

---

## 2.2

- **`/worktree` command** - Create an isolated parallel session from inside Cursor with one command. Creates a worktree, installs npm dependencies, copies `.env.local`, and prints the path to open in a new window. Pairs with `/document` for end-of-session cleanup (PR creation and worktree deletion).
- **`cp` permission added** - `Bash(cp *)` added to `settings.local.json` for copying `.env.local` into worktrees.

---

## 2.1.1

- **API-KEYS.md guide** - New beginner-friendly guide for setting up API keys using environment variables (recommended) or `.env.local` (fallback). Covers OpenAI and Gemini setup for bash/zsh and PowerShell.
- **Plan folder convention** - Plans now live in `.claude/plans/PLAN-issue-XX.md` (matching PLM project pattern). `/create-plan`, `/review-plan`, and `/review-full` updated. Legacy root-level plans still detected.
- **Version numbers aligned** - `package.json` (2.1.0), `VERSION` (2.1), and `CHANGELOG` now agree.
- **PowerShell .gitignore merge** - `setup.ps1` now merges `.gitignore` entries instead of overwriting (matching `setup.sh` behavior).
- **Script improvements** - File size guard (500KB limit), progress feedback during API calls, Gemini client initialized once, tighter transient error detection.
- **README setup restructured** - Two-path decision (Quick Setup vs Reusable Command) replaces four equal-weight options. Advanced options in collapsible section.
- **Debate file safety** - `/ask-gpt` and `/ask-gemini` now write each round to separate files and concatenate at summary, preventing data loss from mid-write errors.
- **Command prompt fixes** - Clearer wording in debate commands, explicit file overlap guidance in `/execute`, commit convention reference in `/document`, error handling notes, routing header on `/pair-debug`, `<rules>` tags on `pair-debug` and `create-issue`.
- **Explore Phase 2 structured** - Codebase analysis phase now has clear guidance on what to look at, when to stop, and what to present.
- **Missing permissions added** - `git worktree` and `git rev-parse` in `settings.local.json`.

---

## 2.1

- **Worktree support for multi-session workflows** - Running multiple Claude Code sessions no longer causes branch conflicts. The toolkit now detects worktree sessions and manages them automatically.
  - `/explore` and `/create-plan` auto-rename the worktree branch to `worktree-<issue-number>-<short-label>` when an issue is referenced
  - `/document` creates a PR from the worktree branch and offers to delete the worktree folder when you're done
  - New "Worktree Workflow" section in toolkit rules with setup guidance and conventions
  - `git worktree` added to the permissions table

---

## 2.0

- **`/review` renamed to `/review-code`** - The old `/review` command is now `/review-code`. Same functionality, plus a 4th sub-agent (Performance & Maintainability) and severity anchors.
- **4 new review commands** - Specialized reviews for different types of work:
  - `/review-commands` - Review slash command prompts for quality, workflow completeness, and cross-command consistency. Staff PM check.
  - `/review-plan` - Check if implementation matches a plan file. Auto-detects the most recent plan in `.claude/plans/`. Staff PM check.
  - `/review-ux` - UX review from code/markup - usability, accessibility, user flows, plus competitive research via web search. Staff Designer check.
  - `/review-full` - Pre-release cross-domain check. Mile wide, inch deep. Ends with Ready / Ready with conditions / Not ready recommendation. Staff Architect check.
- **Severity anchors** - All review commands share minimum severity floors: security exposure, data loss, accessibility blockers, and unmet requirements are never downgraded below Warn.
- **"Use this when" guidance** - Every review command now has clear guidance at the top for when to use it and when not to.
- **Removed `/ui-spec` command** - The `/ui-spec` command, `.claude/ui-reference/` folder, and all references have been removed. UI/UX preferences are now handled directly in `/explore` and `/create-plan`.
- **UI/UX preferences in `/explore` and `/create-plan`** - `/explore` now proactively asks about look and behavior for UI features. `/create-plan` includes an optional UI/UX Design section in the plan template.

---

## 1.4.4

- **Full default permissions** - `settings.local.json` now ships with 51 permissions covering all toolkit workflows (git, gh, npm, debate scripts, file tools, web tools, utilities). New projects no longer need to approve actions one by one. (Issue #53)
- **Permission syntax fix** - Migrated from deprecated `:*` syntax to space-asterisk (`Bash(git commit *)`) across both settings files.
- **Command templates use Write tool** - `/ask-gpt` and `/ask-gemini` now use Claude's Write tool instead of `cat` heredocs for creating context and debate files. Avoids permission prompts and follows Claude Code best practices.
- **`defaultMode: acceptEdits`** - New projects default to auto-approving file edits after a command is given. Plans and reports still show before execution.
- **Cleaned up settings.json** - Removed 3 redundant permission entries that are now covered by `settings.local.json`.

---

## 1.4.3

- **Fix: stale global commands** - Setup scripts (`setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`) now detect when `~/.claude/commands/` has files that share names with toolkit commands and warn you. Global copies override project-level commands, which causes outdated behavior even after updating the toolkit. Fix: delete the global copies. (Issue #52)
- **Troubleshooting docs** - Added "Commands seem outdated" entry to AGENT-SETUP.md, SETUP.md, and README.md.

---

## 1.4.2

- **Version discoverability** - Setup now stamps the installed version into `.claude/rules/toolkit.md` so users can check what version they're running. README has a new "Checking Your Version" section explaining where to look and how to update.
- **README: "How It Works" section** - New section explaining the file architecture: which files are yours (CLAUDE.md, LESSONS.md) vs. managed by the toolkit (toolkit.md, commands). Answers "why is CLAUDE.md empty?" and "how does Claude find toolkit.md?"
- ~~**README: "UI Spec & Design" section** - New section explaining what `.claude/ui-reference/` contains, that reference files are read-only libraries, and the `/ui-spec` -> `UI-SPEC-*.md` -> `/execute` flow.~~ (Removed in v2)
- **CLAUDE.md guiding comments** - Added HTML comments explaining this file is yours and pointing to toolkit.md and README for context.

---

## 1.4.1

- **XML structural tags** - Added XML tags (`<rules>`, `<procedure>`, `<template>`, `<output_format>`, `<conditions>`, `<guidelines>`, `<reference>`, `<phase>`, `<examples>`) to 9 AI-parsed files. Helps AI models distinguish content types (rules vs templates vs examples). Markdown headers stay for readability; XML wraps content blocks for parsing. No behavior change for users.

---

## 1.4

- *Note: This version introduced `/ui-spec` and related UI features, which were removed in v2.0.*
- **Model updates** - `/ask-gpt` now defaults to GPT-5.4 (was 5.2). `/ask-gemini` now defaults to Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview (was 3 Flash Preview).

---

## 1.2

- **`/review` refined** - Cleaned up the two-mode review introduced in v1.1 (removed "What Claude Missed" self-check, simplified sub-agent coordination).
- **Toolkit versioning** - Setup scripts now display version number in banner. VERSION file at repo root.

---

## 1.1

### Ruflo Patterns

Adopted 5 patterns from AI research to improve the core commands.

**`/review` - Simplified Two-Mode Review:**
- Small changes (1-2 files): single-pass review, no sub-agents
- Bigger changes (3+ files): three focused sub-agents in parallel - Security, Code Quality, Logic
- Severity: 🚫 Block / ⚠️ Warn / 💡 Suggest
- Finding IDs (R1, R2...) - say "fix R2 and R5" to approve specific fixes
- Staff Engineer Check for big-picture evaluation

**`/pair-debug` - New Command:**
- Focused debugging partner (not a teacher - that's `/learning-opportunity`)
- Logs-first habit: always starts with "check the logs"
- Repro contract: gathers expected vs actual, error text, environment
- Hypothesis + check IDs (H1/H2, C1/C2) - user picks which check to run

**`/create-plan` - Parallelization Tags:**
- Steps tagged `[parallel]` or `[sequential]` with deliverables and dependencies
- Optional Goal State section for features with 3+ steps

**`/execute` - Parallel Execution:**
- Pre-flight check: lists files per agent, downgrades to sequential if overlap
- User confirmation before spawning parallel work
- Integration checkpoint after parallel steps complete

**Compaction:**
- `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` set to 65% in `.claude/settings.json`

---

### Breaking: CLAUDE.md Split

Toolkit instructions have moved out of `CLAUDE.md` into `.claude/rules/toolkit.md`.

**What changed:**
- `CLAUDE.md` is now a short, project-specific template (your project info, preferences)
- `.claude/rules/toolkit.md` contains all toolkit rules (workflow, commands, git guidance, permissions)
- `toolkit.md` is auto-loaded by Claude Code and always updated when you re-run setup
- `CLAUDE.md` is never overwritten - it's yours to customize

**What existing users need to do:**
1. Re-run setup (`setup-claude-toolkit .` or `bash /path/to/setup.sh`)
2. Move any project-specific info from your old `CLAUDE.md` into the new `CLAUDE.md` template
3. Delete your old `CLAUDE.md` and re-run setup if you want a fresh template

**Why:** Previously, toolkit updates couldn't reach existing users because `CLAUDE.md` was skipped if it existed. Now, toolkit rules update automatically via `toolkit.md`, and your project info stays safe in `CLAUDE.md`.

### New Features

- **LESSONS.md** - Track what you learn across sessions. Created on first setup, never overwritten.
- **Staff Engineer Check** in `/review` - Big-picture evaluation: right approach, shortcuts to clean up, what to push back on
- **Outcomes section** in `/create-plan` - Record what actually happened vs. what was planned
- **"When to Stop"** in `/execute` - Stop and re-plan on critical blockers instead of pushing through
- **Subagent Strategy** - Guidance for Claude to use subagents for research and parallelize independent work

### Fixes

- **`/document` command** - Now aware of LESSONS.md and CHANGELOG.md. Includes file ownership guidance (won't edit `toolkit.md`). Clarifies what goes where: README for features, CLAUDE.md for project info, CHANGELOG for user-facing changes, LESSONS for learnings.
