# Feature Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `50%`

## TLDR
Add a 1-2 sentence note to README.md for users who don't use Cursor, pointing them to ask any AI assistant to adapt the setup steps for their editor. Addresses issue #16.

## Critical Decisions
- **Placement:** After the SETUP.md callout in "Setting Up a Brand New Computer" section — that's where someone first hits the Cursor assumption
- **Scope:** README.md only, not SETUP.md — one place, zero maintenance burden
- **Wording:** "any AI assistant" instead of naming a specific tool — stays neutral

## Tasks

- [x] 🟩 **Step 1: Add the note to README.md**
  - [x] 🟩 Write 1-2 sentences after line 43 (below the SETUP.md callout)
  - [x] 🟩 Verify it reads naturally in context

- [ ] 🟨 **Step 2: Commit and close issue**
  - [ ] 🟨 Commit the change
  - [ ] 🟥 Close issue #16
